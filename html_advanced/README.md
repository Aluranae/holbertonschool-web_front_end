# Techium - Advanced HTML Project

Welcome to the **Advanced HTML** project from Holberton School. This project focuses on building a multipage website called **Techium**, designed to demonstrate a strong understanding of HTML semantics, accessibility, multimedia integration, and modern web structure.

## 🧠 Purpose of the Project

This project aims to solidify your grasp of advanced HTML concepts by implementing a full website using only HTML. It reinforces how to:

- Structure a professional multipage website.
- Use semantic HTML5 elements appropriately.
- Apply best practices for accessibility.
- Embed media content such as images, video, and audio.
- Organize content for reuse and scalability.
- Validate code against W3C standards (except for specified tasks).

## 🧱 Project Structure

The site is composed of several key HTML pages:

- `index.html`: The homepage with logo, sections, footer, and embedded SVG social icons.
- `styleguide.html`: A comprehensive guide displaying all reusable HTML components (typography, buttons, forms, tables, etc.).

Each file is manually coded using HTML5 and respects the structure expected of a professional, maintainable website.

## 🧩 Key Features Implemented

- ✅ Semantic layout using `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- ✅ Navigation bar with anchor links
- ✅ Responsive logo as an image (replacing text)
- ✅ Reusable sections for content: Works, About Us, Testimonials, Latest News, etc.
- ✅ Integration of multiple images with alt attributes and dimensions
- ✅ SVG icons for social media in footer (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
- ✅ Embedded video (HTML5 player with loop and poster)
- ✅ Embedded audio (HTML5 audio player)
- ✅ Iframe (YouTube embed) to demonstrate integration of external sources

## 🧪 W3C Validation

Most of the files pass W3C validation. Some final tasks (SVG icons, multimedia embeds) were explicitly allowed to bypass validation requirements.
